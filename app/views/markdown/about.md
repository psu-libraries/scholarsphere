## About ScholarSphere 

ScholarSphere is an institutional repository managed by Penn State University Libraries. Anyone with a Penn State Access ID can deposit materials relating to the University’s teaching, learning, and research mission to ScholarSphere. All types of scholarly materials, including publications, instructional materials, creative works, and research data are accepted.

ScholarSphere supports Penn State’s commitment to open access and open science. Researchers at Penn State can use ScholarSphere to satisfy open access and data availability requirements (e.g., F.A.I.R) from funding agencies and publishers. 

Penn State's [open access policy](https://openaccess.psu.edu/)  (AC02: Open Access to Scholarly Articles) requires that university researchers provide the [post-print version](http://psu.libanswers.com/faq/273465) of their published scholarly articles to the University Libraries to be made available to the public (unless the authors have obtained a waiver). Depositing in ScholarSphere satisfies this requirement.
