# About ScholarSphere

## As the institutional repository for Penn State, ScholarSphere provides the following:

-   A self-deposit service for faculty, students, and staff to make their scholarship openly accessible.
-   Flexible access and visibility controls for the content you deposit.
-   Assistance in complying with data management planning and data sharing requirements.
-   A service for researchers to deposit their datasets and link to them from their published articles, as often required by journal publishers.

The University Faculty Senate at Penn State passed an open access resolution in April 2015.Faculty are encouraged to share their research outputs via ScholarSphere- for articles, deposit the pre-published versions (original manuscripts), or the post-published versions (i.e., peer-reviewed and final version of the article before being sent to the journal for publication - will usually not be formatted to look like the publishedversion).

SHERPA-RoMEO site delineates between pre-prints and post-prints - see: <http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeoinfo.html#prepostprints>.

## Here\'s what ScholarSphere can do for your research:

-   Raise its visibility and discoverability via major search engines, such as Google.
-   Give persistent access to your work (so that links to it do not fail).
-   Preserve it for the long term, safely and securely.

## ScholarSphere collects the following types of content:

-   Scholarship in the form of articles, presentations, posters, open access books, reports, research papers,and more.
-   Research datasets in a variety of formats.
-   For more information, see [ScholarSphere\'s content policy below](#Content-Policy).

For more details about what is permitted to deposit and what is not permitted (e.g., sensitive data), please review our [Content Policy](#Content-Policy) below.

# Policies

## Content Policy

**What is permitted in ScholarSphere:** content primarily of scholarly import, including curricular materials and creative works produced in support of Penn State\'s teaching, learning, and research mission. Such content may include but is not limited to the following:

-   Original manuscripts of accepted publications (pre-peer-reviewed versions) and final pre-publication drafts (post-peer-reviewed versions)
-   Data sets
-   Working papers
-   Technical reports
-   Conference papers and presentations Research materials in audio/visual formats (what may be deposited will depend on file
    size)

ScholarSphere makes no restrictions on the state of the research submitted, as long the depositing author deems the item in a **complete enough state to share and distribute.**

**What is NOT permitted in ScholarSphere:** content that is not scholarly and content that is sensitive, such as the following: 

-   Files showing personal signatures
-   Résumés and CVs
-   Student work unless it is based on sponsored research at PSU
-   Personally identifiable information (PII), such as social security numbers and such other content as covered by the [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)](http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) and the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act(HIPAA)](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/index.html)
-   Specific locations of endangered plants and animals, and protected archeological sites

Research involving the use of human subjects must be approved by Penn State\'s Institutional Review Board (IRB), and proper consent must be obtained from participants in order to share their information.

If any sensitive or non-scholarly content is found in ScholarSphere, the files will immediately be made private; the depositors will be notified; and the content will likely be withdrawn from the system.

If you are unsure whether your data is considered sensitive, please consult Penn State policy [AD95](https://policy.psu.edu/policies/ad95) or contact the ScholarSphere service team via the [Contact Form](https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/contact). In addition, ScholarSphere will not accept content if it is in violation of copyright agreements. In the event that such violations are found, ScholarSphere reserves the right to withdraw the submitted content. See our [Deposit Agreement](#ScholarSphere-Deposit-Agreement) for clarification.

ScholarSphere welcomes deposits from the Penn State community - faculty, students (undergraduates and graduates), postdoctoral researchers, administrators, and staff. Deposit of Penn State co-authored materials is also encouraged, provided the co-author has secured any requisite copyright permissions for deposit in ScholarSphere.

## Deposit Policy

Depositing your work in ScholarSphere means the following:

-   The deposit represents your own work (and that of your co-authors, if this is jointly created work)
-   Your work does not contain any confidential or proprietary information, or personally identifiable information that would compromise someone\'s privacy)
-   You (and any co-authors) retain copyright to the work and the right to use all or part in future works
-   Research data will be reviewed and curated with the help of the creators. 
-   Research data should include
    -   A README file
    -   Data dictionaries for tabular data
    -   Other relevant metadata and documentation

Deposit of content to ScholarSphere grants Penn State University non-exclusive rights for preserving that content and, if you choose, disseminating that content (see our \"Preservation Policy\" below). To increase the reach, impact, sharing, and preservation of the research, Penn State and ScholarSphere allow content that has been deposited in other repository services to be deposited as well in ScholarSphere, assuming the depositor has not signed an exclusive licensing agreement with another entity. The deposited materials may be freely deposited and distributed elsewhere, in venues such as disciplinary data repositories, electronic journals, pre-print archives, conference proceedings, or course/learning management systems. Please consult our [Deposit Agreement](#ScholarSphere-Deposit-Agreement) for clarification. 

As part of the deposit process, the depositor will be prompted to describe the file (content) that has been uploaded. This process includes selecting a Creative Commons license that describes what the depositor permits others to do with the uploaded content. The default license level (i.e., the license level that automatically appears in the \"Rights\" field) is Attribution-Non-Commercial-No-Derivs 3.0, or CC-BY-NC-ND. With this license you share your work with others and allow them to download it, provided they attribute you as the creator; they must also refrain from changing the content in any way and from using it for commercial means. HOWEVER, you may select a different license in the drop-down menu. For further guidance, please consult the [Help page](https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/help#collapseIP1), where we address Creative Commons in the [FAQ](https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/help/#faq).

## Preservation Support Policy

Penn State Libraries and Information Technology Services are committed to providing long-term access to all material submitted to ScholarSphere. Initial preservation services have been informed by international standards and best practices. In addition to providing basic services like secure storage and redundancy, ScholarSphere has been designed to preserve all content in the form it is deposited.

All work submitted to ScholarSphere will be preserved at a basic bit-level. File characteristics (such as format, mime type, date created) will be captured and stored as metadata during the deposit process to mitigate potential format obsolescence. All files deposited will receive a SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm) checksum, which is used to document file integrity over time. Regular file integrity checks will be run to check for changes (such as file corruption), and can even be scheduled on-demand.

Beyond this initial level of preservation, the ScholarSphere team is planning for additional preservation services, including file migration and normalization. Details of new services will be announced as they are released.

Certain file formats (such as openly-documented, non-proprietary, lossless) are more easily preserved than others. To better assist contributors, ScholarSphere will in the future provide guidance related to file formats and documentary types.

## Visibility (Access Levels) and Sharing

The depositor sets permissions during the upload process. Access permissions give the depositor of content the ability to control who can find, see, edit and download their content. You have the option of setting both \"Visibility\" (who can see an item) and \"Share With\" (who can edit.) ScholarSphere used the following visibility settings.

- **Public:** The default setting for visibility of your content is **Public**. The **Public** setting will allow your content to be discovered in Google and accessed by anyone. 
- **Penn State:** Allows only users who are logged into ScholarSphere (via WebAccess) to view the content. 
- **Embargoed:** Keeps your content private or open only to Penn State until a specified date (no more than 3 years). At this point your content will become public.
- **Leased:** Makes your content initially public then reverts to Penn State only or Private after the specified amount of time.
- **Share With Collaborates:** You may grant \"View/Download\" or \"Edit\" access for specific users and/or groups to files. Enter a valid Penn State Access Account Id, one at a time, select the access level for that user and click Add. The list of groups in the drop-down marked \"Select a group\" is a list of User Managed Groups managed by Penn State\'s ITS department. You may select a specific group and assign an access level for a file within ScholarSphere - similar to adding user access levels. However, management of these groups and their membership is handled centrally at umg.its.psu.edu.

### Permission Definitions

- **View/Download:** This file (both contents and metadata) is accessible from within ScholarSphere.
- **Edit:** This file (both contents and metadata) can be edited. You may only grant this permission to Penn State users and/or groups.


# ScholarSphere Deposit Agreement

To properly administer this repository and preserve the contents of ScholarSphere for future use, The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) requires certain permissions from you, the author(s), or copyright owner. By accepting this license, you do not give up the copyright to your work. You do not give up the right to submit the work to publishers or other repositories. You grant to Penn State the non-exclusive right to store your work. You agree that Penn State may translate the submission to any medium or format and keep more than one copy for the purposes of security, back up and long-term preservation of the scholarly record. Penn State will not make any alteration, other than as allowed by this license, to your submission.

When you submit your file(s) you will have the option of selecting its degree of Visibility on the Web, which will control who can access your materials. Certain license terms apply to each visibility level:

## Visibility Level: OPEN ACCESS

By choosing the Open Access option you are allowing anyone in the world to view your submission. You may choose to apply one of several Creative Commons licenses to your submission, which are explained on the submission form and in the FAQ. These licenses allow you to set your own terms of use for anyone accessing the submission. You authorize Penn State to distribute your content under the terms of that Creative Commons license and to allow users of ScholarSphere to do the same if your license choice permits that. If you do not choose a license, you grant to Penn State the non-exclusive right to distribute your submission (including the metadata and abstract) worldwide, in any format or medium for non-commercial, research, educational, or related academic purposes only. You also authorize Penn State to allow users of the repository to distribute your submission (including the metadata and abstract) worldwide, in any format or medium for non-commercial, research, educational, or related academic purposes only. Penn State will clearly identify your name(s) as the author(s) or owner(s) of the submission, and will not make any alteration, other than as allowed by this license, to your submission.

## Visibility Level: PENN STATE

If you select the Penn State access option, you have decided to restrict access only to users of Penn States network. Your deposit will not be accessible to colleagues or students at other universities or to members of the public. If you want your work to be accessible to the broader scholarly community, you should consider the regular Open Access option instead. If you choose, you may also further limit access to specific individuals or groups of individuals at Penn State.

By clicking through this license, you grant to Penn State the non-exclusive right to reproduce and/or distribute your submission (including the metadata and abstract) to students, faculty, staff, and walk-in users of the Penn State libraries, in any format or medium for non-commercial, research, educational, or related academic purposes only. If you have limited access to specific individuals or groups, Penn State will distribute your submission ONLY to those users. You also authorize Penn State to allow Penn State community users of the repository to distribute your submission (including the metadata and abstract) in any format or medium for Penn State internal non-commercial, research, educational, or related academic purposes only. Penn State will clearly identify your name(s) as the author(s) or owner(s) of the submission, and will not make any alteration, other than as allowed by this license, to your submission.

## Visibility Level: PRIVATE

If you have selected the PRIVATE access option in the ScholarSphere deposit process, you have decided to allow Penn State a more limited set of rights than those afforded under the Open Access license option. Your deposit will not be accessible to anyone other than yourself. If you want your work to be accessible to the broader scholarly community, you should consider the regular Open Access or Penn State settings instead.

## The following terms apply to ALL submissions:

You agree that Penn State bears no responsibility for the contents of your submission. You represent that the submission is your original work, and/or that you have the right to grant the rights contained in this license. You also represent that your submission does not, to the best of your knowledge, infringe upon anyone\'s copyright. You also represent and warrant that the submission contains no libelous or other unlawful matter and makes no improper invasion of the privacy of any other person.

If the submission contains material for which you do not hold copyright and that exceeds fair use, you represent that you have obtained the unrestricted permission of the copyright owner to grant Penn State the rights required by this license, and that such third-party owned material is clearly identified and acknowledged within the text or content of the submission.

IF THE SUBMISSION IS BASED UPON WORK THAT HAS BEEN SPONSORED OR SUPPORTED BY AN AGENCY OR ORGANIZATION OTHER THAN PENN STATE SUCH AS, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, OR A PRIVATE FUNDER, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE FULFILLED ANY RIGHT OF REVIEW, CONFIDENTIALITY, OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS REQUIRED BY THAT CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT.
